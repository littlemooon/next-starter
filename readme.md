# next-starter

Starter structure with full development setup - including linting, testing and type checking.

Some configuration is customised to my liking as this starter project is in active use by myself. I might split some of this into a cli util at some point, akin to react-scripts.

### get started

1. create a new repo in github (or wherever) called `your-next-project`
2. clone this repo into a new folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/littlemooon/next-starter your-next-project
```
3. set the remote origin
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-name/your-next-project.git
```
4. push the repo
```bash
git push
```

### scripts

```bash
npm i
npm run dev

npm run build
npm run start

npm run test
npm run test:watch

npm run flow
npm run flow:build
```
